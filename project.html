            <h2><a href="https://github.com/linhkhnguyen98/Huffman-Tree" title="DATA COMPRESSION" style="font-style: italic;">DATA COMPRESSION</a></h2>
            
            <p>Create a Huffman Tree algorithm in C++ to efficiently compress and decompress files. 
                The Huffman Tree will be employed to encode the data in a compressed format, reducing its size while preserving its content. 
                Additionally, utilize serialization techniques within the C++ codebase to optimize the compression and decompression processes. 
                Serialization enables the conversion of complex data structures, such as the Huffman Tree, into a stream of bytes for efficient storage and retrieval. 
                By integrating serialization, the compression and decompression operations become more streamlined and resource-efficient, 
                enhancing overall performance and usability of the system.

            <p>Develop an undirected graph in C++ encompassing fundamental properties such as vertices and edges, 
                along with essential operations like adding and removing vertices/edges, and traversing the graph. 
                Furthermore, implement advanced functionalities including finding the shortest path between vertices using Dijkstra's Algorithm, 
                which efficiently calculates the weighted shortest path. Additionally, incorporate Kruskal's Algorithm to determine the smallest connecting threshold, 
                facilitating the identification of the minimum spanning tree within the graph. By integrating these algorithms, the graph becomes a versatile tool capable 
                of not only representing relationships but also performing complex analyses to extract meaningful insights.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/linhkhnguyen98/Recommender-System" title="VIDEO GAME RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS" style="font-style: italic;">VIDEO GAME RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS</a></h2>
            
            <p>Developing a robust recommender system tailored for Steam video games leveraging Python's versatile capabilities. 
                The system employs a sophisticated Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model, implemented using TensorFlow, 
                to predict user preferences and recommend games accordingly. Specifically, the model excels in Play Prediction, 
                accurately suggesting games that users are likely to enjoy based on their historical gaming behavior and preferences.
                The refinement process entails meticulous adjustments aimed at optimizing accuracy metrics, such as Mean Square Error, 
                resulting in notable reductions and ensuring the system's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Through this comprehensive approach, 
                the recommender system not only delivers personalized and relevant recommendations but also demonstrates robust performance and 
                reliability, enhancing the overall user experience on the Steam platform.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/linhkhnguyen98/Pollution-Lookup" title="POLLUTION LOOKUP TABLE" style="font-style: italic;">POLLUTION LOOKUP TABLE</a></h2>
            
            <p>
                Employ a combination of C programming language and Arm assembly language to develop a sophisticated pollution data management system. 
                This system aims to efficiently store pollution data and provide rapid query capabilities based on dates, achieving near-constant time 
                performance. The core of the system involves implementing an in-memory database utilizing a hash table structure with single linked chains 
                for collision resolution. Complementing the C implementation, the system leverages Arm assembly language to optimize critical functions within 
                the lookup table. By writing these functions in assembly language, the system achieves enhanced performance and efficiency, particularly in 
                low-level operations critical for rapid data access and manipulation. By combining efficient data structures, advanced algorithms, 
                and optimized low-level operations, the system delivers rapid query capabilities and robust performance, meeting the stringent 
                requirements of pollution data management while operating seamlessly in the background.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/linhkhnguyen98/Hashmap-Application" title="HASHMAP APPLICATION" style="font-style: italic;">HASHMAP APPLICATION</a></h2>
            
            <p>Incorporating a HashMap data structure to efficiently manage the diverse array of animals housed within the sanctuary, 
                this Java-based system provides a comprehensive organizational framework. The implementation utilizes HashMaps to handle both 
                individual animals and species, offering a scalable solution capable of accommodating varying quantities of animals and species.
                Each animal entry is uniquely identified by its key, typically a unique identifier such as an ID or name, while its corresponding 
                value contains detailed information about the animal, such as its species, age, and health status.
                the integration of HashMaps within this Java-based sanctuary management system enables seamless organization and efficient handling 
                of animals while providing flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and capacities.
